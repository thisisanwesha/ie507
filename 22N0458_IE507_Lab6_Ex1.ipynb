Simla still has demand of 270 truckloads which needs to be fulfilled so now it gets the remaining supply (175) from other cities like Delhi and Mumbai. Lucknow has available stock of 175, so it can send the stock which was previously being supplied to Simla (175) to other cities like Dibrugarh and Raipur.

Kolkata has available stock of 205, so it can send the stock which was previously being supplied to Dibrugarh (95) to other cities like Raipur.\n",
